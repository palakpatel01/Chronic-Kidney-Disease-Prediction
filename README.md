# Chronic-Kidney-Disease-Prediction

This project aims to predict the risk of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using machine learning algorithms. CKD is a serious condition that affects millions of people worldwide, and early detection can significantly improve outcomes.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle. It contains various clinical features such as age, blood pressure, and serum creatinine levels, along with the target variable indicating the presence or absence of CKD.

Preprocessing
Before building the machine learning models, the dataset underwent several preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

Models
Two machine learning models were trained and evaluated for this project: Random Forest and XGBoost. These models were chosen for their ability to handle complex datasets and provide good performance in classification tasks.

Evaluation
The models were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, a confusion matrix was generated to visualize the performance of the models.

Results
The Random Forest model achieved an accuracy of 87%, while the XGBoost model achieved an accuracy of 98%. Both models showed promising performance in predicting CKD risk.

Conclusion
In conclusion, this project demonstrates the use of machine learning algorithms to predict the risk of Chronic Kidney Disease. Early detection of CKD can lead to better management and improved outcomes for patients.
